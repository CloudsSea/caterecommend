I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.","type":"review","user_id":"gJhd8oM1yRDDGe3SPaC5Gw","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}}

I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. \n\nWell I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. \n\nPart of this is my fault...I always order \"healthy\" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  \n\nI started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \n\nMy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\n\nPros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\n\nCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.

It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv.

On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. \n\nThe menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese.

The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion.

You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food.

I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n\nI've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.","type":"review","user_id":"_Ud7sdn_khya8e2f3FNvWA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}}

While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\n\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.","type":"review","user_id":"sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg","votes":{"cool":2,"funny":1,"useful":3}}

Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning.","type":"review","user_id":"9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}}

Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\n\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough.

You get three sliders and they were very good.\n\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree.

We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party...

As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.

The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.\n\nMy only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. \n\nOverall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!","type":"review","user_id":"op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g","votes":{"cool":1,"funny":0,"useful":1}}

Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \n\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \n\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \n\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \n\nThey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \n\nTheir side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! \n\nI usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless.

Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \n\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\n\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks. And for that, Rock Bottom's earned another star in my book.","type":"review","user_id":"DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":1}}

Apps? Bros?

We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn't right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.\n\nWe waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary.

We are abandoning this restaurant.\n\nI don't expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.

I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB.

The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! \n\nI was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.\n\nEverything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.\n\nIn the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings.

I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit, I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here. Naturally, I'm not a stranger to this chain, understand it's a chain, but the past visit here was just not good.\n\nCame with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson. We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money. We were seated in the dining area. Every time we are seated in the dining area it's a bad experience. On the bar side you get entertainment, the beer flights/draft specials are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.\n\nIt started off with the soft drinks. I'm not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky [and yes, I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular]. There was incorrect carbonation, whether they were running out [I suspect this], no ice [lukewarm] or they had just hooked up a new box [unlikely]. I sent it back.\n\nMy brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied. I tried to steal a few of his fries, which were a failure. They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [a full mouth of starch], and were barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On my own dish I had the classic mac n' chicken. First of all, the pasta was crispy?, really?, it wasn't a cheese sauce, it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs. And when I say smothered here, this is not a good thing. Sigh. The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan, which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish, and said it was cooked properly. A small save? \n\nAgain - I sent it back after about 3 bites. The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box, I told her to take it away. She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check, which I didn't see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom, I hope they didn't charge us for the pop drink....

Tried their standard flight and greatly enjoyed the Xm@s but nothing else stood out. Also had the Gentleman, Holly's Mistletoe and Lively. The Gentleman was good in my opinion.  2 out of 8 beers impressed me and above standard for my tastes while the others were below standard when it comes to craft beers.  Again this is my opinion. I have a wide range of styles I enjoy but IPAs are a solid choice for me.  Pricing for flights was excellent at $6 for 6 4oz. tasters.\n\nThe service was lackluster. Myself and two friends were sat and the waitress took my order and the other man but ignored the girl that was with us and walked off without even asking her if she would like anything. She was a bit put off to say the least. We tracked the waitress down and she apologized but the rest of the stay was a bit awkward.  \n\nI hear the food is very good and will return to try it and adjust my review accordingly.","type":"review","user_id":"TyxrMu8pBIF1WrTaTf2q3Q","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}}

It was a short hike from the theater, but I am not cold tolerant, and was glad of the warm, comfortable restaurant interior.  It was pretty empty (my favorite), and we were ushered to a booth, which was roomy and comfortable.  \n\nOur server was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations.  The beers were very tasty!  Even though we were starving, our server recommended getting 1/2 order of nachos if we planned to get dinner.  GOOD TIP!!!  The half order of nachos is piled on to a traditional dinner plate, and it was plenty of appetizer for 2 people.  My friend got the country fried chicken with mashed potatoes and slaw.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I got the veggie pizza with feta, which was good, but I think I would have been happier with something else.  There was no fatal flaw in the pizza, I think I was stuck eating bread with grilled veggies and feta while my friend ate fried chicken- and that was entirely my fault. \n\nOverall, this was a positive experience.  It has a \"chain\" feel (because it is a chain), but I would go back and recommend it to others.  It is for foodies? Nope.  It is amazingly original?  Nope.  But it is good food, good beer, good service, and a fair price.  Definitely.","type":"review","user_id":"gILQPFOkYOJaDv3ZhLszLg","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":1}}

It was below freezing out, and we were both really cold. The food was great though when it came, and it somewhat warned us up. We ordered the tortilla soup, nachos, Diablo pizza, and 2 am burger. The soup was delicious. I'm itching to have another bowl already. I also tried their darkest beer that had hints of cacao and peanut butter. I'm not a beer fan, but I really liked it.

It was wonderful! I think I went back the next night because I had such a good experience. It's pretty much always packed around happy hour/dinner time because it's a great spot. \n\nThe Pittsburgh location doesn't quite compare. The actual layout, food, service, etc., is average. I ordered the bison burger last night and it was pretty good. But, it was a bit dry and it didn't seem like they put much effort into it. Honesty, when I received my food, it reminded me of being at a place like Applebee's of Chili's. They were out of Mac and cheese because they had had a busy night. I didn't mind that at all because I had tried the Mac and cheese before; you should give it a try if you haven't. \n\nThe waitress was great. She checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. The menu is large. You're sure to find something you want to try. But it's a brewery, so the options are mostly variations of bar foods. It's a cool place to go if you want to eat late and have a decent sized group with you.","type":"review","user_id":"78df08rvfTRKXcqxz3eS0A","votes":{"cool":0,"funny":0,"useful":0}}

Once we were seated, our waiter was quick but that's just about the extent of anything nice I have to say. The other folks in our party mentioned that the burgers were pretty good; however, my Cuban Cristo was a mess. It had too much batter and was fried too long, resulting in a greasy, brick of a sandwich. And, for a brewery, I was extremely disappointed by the small size of their beer list.

They sent the burnt broccoli back and I got a great salad, the steak had to go all the way to well done, but I believe the grill is not being clean properly cause the steak tasted burnt and charred. So the manager came over and ask my boyfriend if he wanted something else, he didn't and he asked me how he could make it better, I asked that next time could we have are food done properly cooked.
